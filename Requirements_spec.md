***Requirements spec to show git merges***

**Business Context**
Git uses a really cool storage an accounting mechanism to keep track of changes remotely and locally.
This demo shows you how to use merge resolution to deal with merge conflicts.

**Problem Statement**
The problem arises when two people try to change the same code in the same file. 
The remote repo doesn't know how to allow you to 'merge' the changes. 

This is a new line and won't cause a merge conflict - we can merge automatically.
